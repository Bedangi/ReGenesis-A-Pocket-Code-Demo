6. Crafted tools unlock new interactions and progression

## Educational Value
The game encourages:
1.Logical reasoning
2.Cause–effect thinking
3.Understanding progression systems
4.Problem-solving through experimentation

## Future Work
1. Modular and scalable inventory system
2. Save and load game progress
3. Tool durability and breakage system
4. Multi-tier tools and resources
5. Testing and Optimization
